# Assignment3: File Handling in C++ Part1

## Overview

This assignment involves file handling in C++ to read and process triangle data from a file. 

The implementation is split between two files: `Reader.cpp` and `Writer.cpp`.

The tasks include using the `getline()` function, utilizing `istringstream` for string parsing, creating `Point3D` objects, and populating a vector of `Triangle` objects.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Implemented getline() function in getTriangles() in location `assignment-3\Updated Sketchers\src\Reader.cpp`**.

2. **Used an istringstream to parse the string in location`assignment-3\Updated Sketchers\src\Reader.cpp`**.

3. **Taken all values and pass each (x, y, z) values to the point3D class object in location `assignment-3\Updated Sketchers\src\Reader.cpp`**.

4. **Added that object in the Triangle class type vector in location `assignment-3\Updated Sketchers\src\Reader.cpp`**.

**Used a range-for loop to print out the data from each object in write() function in location `assignment-3\Updated Sketchers\src\Writer.cpp`**.
