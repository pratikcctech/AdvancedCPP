# Assignment 1 - Classes and Strings

## Overview

   In this Assignment we need to create the class and add the method in it with taking the string as parameter to perform operation.

   so in this folder the class `Writer` and some member function which takes a string as parameter and perform some operation . 

   the `Writer` class perform the read the stl file and load all the point into the program.

## Implementation Steps


   `Writer::Writer()`: Constructor 

   `Writer::~Writer()`: Destructor. This doesn't do anything specific in this case.

   - the `Writer` Class Definition path: `assignment-1\headers\Writer.h`.

   -their respective defination intheir respective cpp files  `assignment-1\src\Writer.cpp`.

   - Add member functions (getters) to the class to display the member variables of the class.
   - Example: `write` which will take string and it will load the  value of the `triangles` point into the txt file.
